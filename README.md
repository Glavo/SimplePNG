# SimplePNG

A zero-dependency minimalist Java library for creating PNG files.

## Feature

* No dependence, only needs the `java.base` module;
* Very small (< 20 KiB);
* Supports writing compressed or uncompressed PNG images;
* Support for optional alpha channels;
* Support writing PNG metadata.

## Limitations 

* Currently only true color images are supported, support for grayscale images is planned;
* Currently only 8-bit color depth images are supported;
* PNG filter is not supported, it may be supported in the future;
* Color palette is not supported;


## Adding SimplePNG to your build

Under development, I will publish it to Maven Central in the next two days.
